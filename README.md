                                   <b>**CG2AT SCRIPT OVERVIEW**</b>
</p>

The script is a fragment based conversion of the CG representation into atomistic. 

This script roughly follows the following workflow.

- Center fragments based on the center of mass (COM) of heavy atoms.
- Rotate fragments to find minimum distance between the atoms connecting to other beads.
- Minimise residue
- Merge all residues and minimise
- check for abnormal bonds (marker for lipid through rings)
- Run NVT and NPT
- Morph protein to either rigid body alignment or steered alignment

                                   <b>**INPUT**</b>
</p>

The script contains two methods to rebuild the system:

- de novo method, following the protocol described in the script overview section.
- flexible fitting of a user supplied atomistic structure (prefereably the one used to make the CG representation).

To convert your system, all you need to do is supply the coarsegrain system.

However, the quality of the conversion is improved if you can provide the starting atomistic structure used to create the CG model.

All user supplied structures should be in a single file. The atomistic segments are then aligned to the coarsegrain initially by sequence.

Both input files must be in the following file formats:

- pdb
- gro
- tpr

If only partial structures are supplied, then the script will build in the missing residues from the de novo build. 

For example if you have a signal peptide linked via a flexible linker to the main protein.

You can just supply the atomistic coordinates for the signal peptide and main protein and the script will build in the linker from the de novo method.

the script will rigid body fit the helix and cytosolic protein separately and fill in the linker from the de novo construct.

This script will try to use 8 cores preferentially, if your computer has less than 8 it will use all the cores. 

To override this and limit the number of cores you can use the flag:

- -ncpus (int)

- Sequence for chains
- COM of each chain
- Rotation of each chain to find optimum fitting
- Timings for each section of the script

</p>
                                        

The script currently finds disulphide bonds in the user supplied atomistic structure (S-S < 2.1 A).
As well as searching the CG representation for disulphide bonds (SC1-SC1 < 7 A and more than 4 residues apart).
If the disulphide only exists in the CG, then the script will ask if it is a disuphide. 
To silence the question and automatically select disulphides use the flag: 

- -silent

In most cases the script catches the extra long disulphide bonds in martini simulations, however in some cases the disulphide can extend up to 10A.
If you recieve a error that the pdb and topology don't match and the atom number is out by 2. It is most likely a disulpide bond not being treated correctly.
You may be able to fix it by increasing the disulphide bond search radius catch using the flag:

- -cys (default = 7 A)

</p>
                                        

If you are converting a multimeric protein, such as a potassium channel. You can fit the atomistic structure in several ways:

fit by coarse grain chain.

- -group chain

fit entire atomistic structure rigidly

- -group all

fit chains in specific groups (treat chains 0, 2 and 1, 3 as individual groups).
each group is separated by a space.

- -group 0,2 1,3

                                   <b>Swap residues and beads</b>
</p>
                                        

Due to the modular nature of CG representation, you can switch residues during the conversion if you wish to make simple mutations.

If the residue you are swapping to has the same number or fewer CG beads you can use the following flag to change the residue.

- -swap  

Usage

             From        :              To           :    range
      resname,bead,bead  :     resname,bead,bead     :  0-10,30-40

Examples: 

If the beads are the same:

swap all ASP to ASN:
- -swap ASP:ASN

swap ASP to ASN in the resid range 0-10 and 30-40:
- -swap ASP:ASN:0-10,30-40

If the beads are different:

switch residues with different beads:
- -swap POPC,NC3:POPG,GL0

if you wish to switch within the same residue:
- -swap POPG,D2B:POPG,C2B

To skip residues or beads:

to skip a bead.
- -swap GLU,SC2:ASP,skip

to skip a residue.
- -swap POPG:skip

You are not limited to a single residue

The following switches all POPE to POPG and all POPG to POPE
- -swap POPE,NH3:POPG,GL0 POPG,GL0:POPE,NH3

The following will skip all NA+ between resid 4000 and 4100.
- -swap NA+:skip:4000-4100

</p>
                                        

The script provides 3 types of coarsegrain conversions. 

You can select which of these is supplied using the flag:
- -o ['all', 'steer', 'align', 'none']

Standard output:

- De novo method. (final_cg2at_de_novo.pdb)
  - fragments are fitted individually to beads and rotated to minimise bond length to connecting beads.
  - if any lipid tails are detected to be trapped within aromatic rings, a short alchembed step is run on each monomer.
  - if no alchembed step is run, a short NVT run is done instead.

Steered output:

- flexible user supplied atomistic fitting. (final_cg2at_steered.pdb)  
  - Atomistic segments are aligned via sequence to the CG protein.
  - The supplied atomistic structures undertake 2 fitting steps.
    - Each segment is rigid body fitted to the CG backbone beads. 
      - Any missing residues or residue types found in the MOD directory are added from the de novo method.
    - Short steered MD step on selected atoms align the AT protein to the CG representation, preserving most interactions (e.g. backbone H-bonds).   
  - The de novo system is then steered to the coordinates from the AT steered protein.  

Aligned output:

- Rigid body user supplied atomistic fitting. (final_cg2at_aligned.pdb)
  - Atomistic segments are aligned via sequence to the CG protein.
  - Each segment is rigid body fitted to the CG backbone beads. 
    - Any missing residues or residue types found in the MOD directory are added from the de novo method.
  - The de novo system is then steered to the coordinates from the rigidly fit protein.

You can prevent the script from reading any file or folder by prefixing the name with a underscore.

<p align="center">
                                   <b>**Fragments**</b>
</p>

The fragment database is separated into two parts (protein and non-protein).

Each fragment file contains the following flags:

<pre>
[ BB ]
atom 1
atom 2
...
[ SC1 ]
atom 8
atom 9
...

</pre>

The protein section contains all the normal amino acids and post-translationally modified residues.

The normal amino acids fragments do not contain any hydrogens, these are incorporated by pdb2gmx.

Whilst the modified protein and non protein fragments retain their hydrogens. This is due to problematic adding of every residue to the hydrogen database. 

For ring like structures, I have implemented a grouping system.

In this particular case, the fragments SC2 and SC3 are treated as a rigid body in the fitting and rotation steps.

This default grouping can be switched off using the flag:

- -mod

The grouping is especially useful for converting sugar groups in which the hydrogen geometry should be retained as much as possible.

An example of a normal amino acid fragment files:

<pre>
Phenylalanine

For non protein residues you can create a position restraint file which is applied during the creation of the aligned and steered systems.
A script exists within the scripts directory called make_fragments_posre.py this can either create the correct posre files for every residue in the system or for a single residue.

To apply to every folder in directory in non_protein:
<pre>
python make_fragments_posre.py -dir
</pre>
To apply to a single residue:
<pre>
python make_fragments_posre.py -f POPE.itp
</pre>

In the case of solvent. All ions and water molecules are in single repective pdb files with separate groups.

In martini water, 4 atomistic water molecules are condensed into a single bead, therefore the fragment has 4 water molecules.

In the case of ions only the ion is stored as a fragment. During the conversion a water bead is superimposed over the ion, to replace the hydration shell of the ion.

</p>
                                    
Within this script I have included a the reverse of CG2AT. Here the fragment library is used to convert a atomistic system into a coarsegrain representation.

This script roughly follows the following workflow.

- Finds the center of mass of each fragment's heavy atoms as described by the database.
- Writes out a pdb file containing the beads placed at the COM of each fragment.

The conversion follows a similar syntax to CG2AT.

The following flags are required:

- -c (str)
- -at2cg (True/False)

The following flags are optional
- -fg (str)
- -ff (str)
- -swap (eg POPI:POP2)

Due the truncation of PI lipid types residue names to 4 characters. The swap group is required to specify to correct lipid type.

A topology will be provided, however it will require updating with the correct protein information. Places to update are highlighted as "XXX" 

To remake your martini topology of the protein. You will need to rerun martinise.py.

This step was not incorporated as it requires the package DSSP to correctly make the topology.

However the martinise.py script is available with the scripts directory. The initial section of the martinise command to run will be printed at the end of the conversion.
